Tripix is a mobile application available both for iOS and Android platforms which helps users in planning their trips. The way the application makes planning trips easier is by automating the whole process and by suggesting landmarks the user may be interested in visiting. This is a project I have been working with my colleague for a competition called Lumen Development 2020 which is the largest student programming competition in Croatia. We won the 3rd place and got a lot of good feedback on the project.
